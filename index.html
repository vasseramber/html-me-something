      Butterflies
    </header>
    <p>Butterflies are colorful, big-winged insects that flutter when they fly. These eye catching insects drink nectar from flowers as a food source and they start off as catepillers that are sometimes not estetically pleasing to the eye. So here it is, the butterfly. </p>
    <main>
      <p>The beginning stage of a butterfly is a catepliller. The catepiller starts off eating leaves and spraying silk which will later come in handy when they go through metamorphesis. As a catepiller, they still have a great chance of being eaten so some are posionuos, such as the Monarch catepiller due to its milkweed diet, and will kill there their preaditor after being eaten giving instant karma.</p>
      <p>The next stage of a butterfly is the metamorphesis. Metamorphesis means great change and the way the catepiller does this is by using the practice from making silk to cover themselves with or making a chrysalis in which the catepiller molts their skin and forms a chrysalis. </p>
      <p>The last stage of a butterfly is the hatching of the chrysalis. After a period of 10 to 14 days (depending on each species) in a chrysalis, the catepiller has now gone through metamorphesis and has become a butterfly. </p>
